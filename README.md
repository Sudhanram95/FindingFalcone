# FindingFalcone
Finding Falcone is an android project where user has to select four planets and four suitable space vehicles to travel to those planets. The important thing to notice here is the logic used to interpret the planets and vehicles. 

All the logics are properly tested. Instrumental and UI test cases were written as well.
